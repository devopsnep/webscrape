# setup enviroment for ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
# install python pip
    
    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
    sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
# install lxml python
 
    apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev
    If you're happy with a possibly older version of lxml altogether though, you could try
    apt-get install python-lxml
    pip install --upgrade lxml
